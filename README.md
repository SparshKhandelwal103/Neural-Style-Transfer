# Neural-Style-Transfer

## What is This?
A simple, visually striking demo of neural style transfer using Python and TensorFlow. Feed two images—a *content* photo and a *style* painting—and create a new image that combines both.

## Features
- Style any image with the look of a painting (or any artwork).
- Uses TensorFlow Hub's pre-trained model for fast and accurate results.
- Beginner-friendly, well-commented code.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.7+
- tensorflow
- tensorflow_hub
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pillow

- ## How It Works
- Loads your images.
- Uses a TensorFlow Hub model to extract content and style.
- Blends images using an optimization loop.
- Displays and saves the result.

## Credits
Based on TensorFlow’s official tutorial and expanded by me.
